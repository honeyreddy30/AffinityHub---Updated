## I. Introduction
We, Honey Reddy Nagireddy and Preethi Reddy Nagireddy, present this Final Project Proposal for the development of AffinityHub. Our collective passion for technology and the desire to create a vibrant online community have inspired us to conceive AffinityHub. This proposal outlines our vision for a dynamic platform where individuals can connect, share, and explore hobbies.

## II. Purpose of the Proposal
This proposal is all about sharing our idea for AffinityHub, a cool platform where people can connect over their hobbies. The main goal of AffinityHub is to create a friendly space where you can find folks who are into the same things as you, chat about your hobbies, and have interesting conversations. It's not just a regular social platform; it's like a community where you can make real connections and dive deep into your passions. Our focus is on making AffinityHub inclusive and welcoming, so everyone feels at home. We want it to be the go-to place for anyone looking to connect with others who share their interests and make lasting friendships. AffinityHub is all about bringing people together through their hobbies in a simple and enjoyable way.

- **Objective 6.2:** Encourage Local and Global Exchange to maximize user options and platform utility.
- **Objective 6.3:** Enabling users to sell or buy items which are relevant or irrelevant to their hobbies and interests.

We chose to develop this project due to our own introverted natures and deep enthusiasm for hobbies. This application promises to be a valuable tool for those who find face-to-face communication challenging, offering an alternative way to connect by simply sending a message. It's designed to cultivate passion and, by uniting individuals from diverse backgrounds, enhance confidence and foster teamwork.

## IV. Project Description
AffinityHub is envisioned as a comprehensive digital platform designed to connect individuals through shared passions and hobbies. It aims to provide a nurturing and dynamic environment where users can explore new interests, share knowledge, and build relationships with like-minded individuals. Below is a detailed description of the key features and components that will make up AffinityHub:

- **Data Source:**
  - Our project will utilize a variety of data sources to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy. We'll incorporate external APIs to access updated and real-time information from fields relevant to our project. Primarily, we're utilizing external APIs, such as Pexels, for sourcing high-quality images. User-generated content will play a crucial role, as it provides direct insights into user preferences and behaviors, essential for customizing our services.

## VI. Future Work
AffinityHub can be expanded in the future to include:
- **Advanced Matching Algorithm:** Integrate an algorithm to suggest relevant hobby groups based on user interests.
- **Enhanced User Interactions:** Implement features such as emoji reactions and threaded replies for enriched communication.
